# Game-Zone


This is an application for eSports events tracking which supports four eSports game disciplines, such as: CS:GO, Dota 2, Overwatch and Rainbow 6 Siege. You can follow
the games of your favorite teams from here, See their past, running and future matches. Also it is possible to save leagues and check their matches later. You can check
the line-up of the team and see which player participated in which match. Checking the scores in realtime without opening the live is also possible. One of the most
important parts of the application is the built-in chat, with the help of which users can share matches with each other and also have discussions about them.
(Application can work in offline mode)
